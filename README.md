# Facial Recognition Attendance System

## Project Overview

* The Facial Recognition Attendance System is a Python application designed to automate attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. 
* The system leverages computer vision and machine learning libraries to identify individuals and record their attendance. 
* Developed using Python, this system provides a modern and efficient solution for managing attendance records.

## Features
- Facial Recognition: Uses facial recognition algorithms to identify and verify individuals.
- Attendance Logging: Automatically logs attendance based on facial recognition.
- Real-Time Processing: Captures and processes facial data in real-time using a webcam or video feed.
- User Enrollment: Allows new users to be added to the system by capturing their facial data.
- Attendance Report: Generates detailed reports of attendance records for review.
- Data Management: Stores and manages attendance data in a structured format.

## User Interface
The system operates through a command-line interface and/or GUI, depending on the implementation.

- User Enrollment: Capture facial data for new users.
- Attendance Monitoring: Real-time facial recognition for marking attendance.
- Reports/Csv: View and generate attendance reports/csv files.

## Installation Guide
- Clone the Repository:  git clone https://github.com/Shardul-1510/facial-recognition-attendance-system.git

**Navigate to the Project Directory:**
- cd facial-recognition-attendance-system

**Install Required Libraries:**
- pip install -r requirements.txt

**Configure the Application:**
- Ensure you have a compatible webcam or video input device.
- Update configuration files if necessary (e.g., camera settings, file paths).


## Usage
- Enroll Users: Run the user enrollment script to capture and store facial data for new users.
- Monitor Attendance: Start the attendance monitoring script to automatically record attendance as individuals are recognized.
- Generate Reports: Use the system's reporting features to view and export attendance records.

## Configuration
- Configuration File: Modify config.json or similar configuration files to set parameters like camera resolution, output directories, and other settings.
- Data Storage: Attendance data is typically stored in CSV or database format, depending on your setup.
